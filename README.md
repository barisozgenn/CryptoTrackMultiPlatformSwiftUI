# CryptoTrackMultiPlatformSwiftUI
![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platforms-macOS%20%7C%20iOS%20%7C%20tvOS%20%7C%20watchOS-blue)

In this SwiftUI project, I have developed a multiplatform app utilizing the latest features available in the OS versions. The introduction of Swift Charts support for new OS versions inspired me to create a comprehensive cryptocurrency tracking application. Don't you think it's a compelling reason?

To get a better understanding of the project, I have provided an introduction video. Click the link below to watch it.
