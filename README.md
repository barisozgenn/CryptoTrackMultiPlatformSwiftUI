# CryptoTrackMultiPlatformSwiftUI

In this SwiftUI project, I developed a multiplatform app using as many new features as possible in the latest OS versions. Especially the introduction of Swift Charts support for new OS versions encouraged me to develop a cryptocurrency application. Isn't it a good reason? :p
  I will be sharing the link below the description for the introduction video of the project.
